# ML-algorithms-implemantations
Some notebooks that I've created to understand concepts of data science.

Using Base_gerada_KMeans.ipynb is possible create a database to test some
algorithms implemented in KMeans_implementation.ipynb.

In KMeans_implementation.ipynb contains implementations only using numpy
of KMeans, KMedoids, KMedians and euclian distance.
